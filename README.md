# scss starter project

Just a simple scss starter boilerplate which I use when quickly creating css styles.

### Installation

This starter project requires [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) to run.

Install the dependencies and start the server.



```
npm install
gulp
```

This will compile the scss into a single css file in the dist folder and start a browserSync server to display.
